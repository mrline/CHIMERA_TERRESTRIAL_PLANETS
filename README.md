# CHIMERA_TERRESTRIAL_PLANETS
Welcome to the CHIMERA "terresrial" planet transmission retrieval code. This was the code used in Tremblay et al. 2020. Further description of the code/assumptions is in that publication.  Before you begin, we highly recommend that you first do the jupyter notebook tutorials in https://github.com/mrline/CHIMERA before using this.  There you will gain familiarity with retrieval concepts, program flow, and installation of pymultinest.  

Instructions for "use":
1. Pull this repository (all the folders)
2. The ABSCOEFF_TERRESTRIAL folder is empty.  Go to
